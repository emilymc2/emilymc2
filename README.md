- 👋 Hi, I’m @emilymc2
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to program so that I can build mobile and web apps. I am also extremely interested in network security, hacking, and penetration testing. And I love blockchain, crypto, and investing/trading. And cats. I love cats.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C, Solidity, UX Design, HTML/CSS/Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on lots of things, once I get to that point. I actually have an idea for a healthcare app that I would like to pitch to other programmers someday in the near future.
- 📫 How to reach me: ms.emilymcrawford@gmail.com or emilycrawfordandcats@gmail.com
